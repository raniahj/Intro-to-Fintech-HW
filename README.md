### What is Enfusion?
---
Enfusion is a start-up software company located in Chicago, Illinois founded by Tarek Hammoud and Stephen Malherbe.
  There is no specific date for their founding, but the company was created around the year 2006. Enfusion is focused primarily on creating a cloud-based product for asset management.
  According to Bloomberg “The company offers order management, portfolio management, valuation and risk, accounting, reconciliation, reporting, and fund service,”. The company, according to their own site was created with a focus to simplify the fintech infrastructure.
  This came with focus on breaking barriers with technology and information and spreading a level of transparency and efficiency amongst their client.
  Enfusion was started off as an idea of a Portfolio Management System and eventually the founders developed on this prior system by adding more systems to their project idea.
  When it comes to the funding of Enfusion their information is rather private. As of 2017, the amount of funding in Enfusion is undisclosed, how it seems that their lead investor is FTV Capital at the time.
  
### What does Enfusion do?
---
Enfusion is driven to allow institutional asset managers and hedge fund managers to have investment management software and analytics.
  This will give them an efficient and modern result. 
  In this way they can better their client’s experiences with investment while managing their risks.
  They plan to break the boundaries of traditional investment management and fully integrate the offices of investment managers in a single system. The clients of Enfusion mostly consists of investment managers, investment advisors, and traders alike. 
  They pertain to their clients from the usage of their own software called Integrata which is a software that helps with portfolio management, data import and export, and financial modeling.
  This software eliminates the operational risk of manual processes and even includes a double entry General Ledger for automated financial statements. This software uses the Saas system and programming.
  Now other investment management softwares have a similar concept behind them as well. When compared to their leading competitor, Enfusion does not have the performance metric and compliance reporting that emX has for their investment clients.
  
### How is Enfusion doing in Investment Management?
---
Enfusion is a relatively new start-up among fintech investment management companies.
  Enfusion mainly deals with clients from the investment management domain and many big players can be found in domain. 
  There are plenty of financial institutions that handle investment portfolios such as Bank of America, JP Morgan, Fidelity, etc.
  In fact, Fidelity has been looking into ways to integrate their wealth and investment management into the fintech world. This includes merging their financial service models and providing robo-advisor to clients with a minimum $50,000 investment. In the investment management domain, in the last 5-10 years, there has been a shift from active management to passive management.
  In addition to companies like Fidelity, the domain has been having a shift to become more technologically dependent and as a result they made the possibility of investment management more accessible to people outside of your typical professional investor.
  Also, while wanting to attract more people to their institution, it’s been a current trend for companies to cut down on their fees.
  
### How does Enfusion compare?
---
Enfusion seems to do relatively well in companies.
  It has even been named the leading global provider of investment management technology solutions and services by PR Newswire.
  Enfusion has made a rather noticeable impact in the way the investment management infrastructure functions.
  Especially nowadays with the effect of COVID-19 as they have added extra stress in the areas of cost pressure and transparency. 
  According to Markets Insider, “according to recent industry research, nearly three-quarters of hedge fund managers are outsourcing at least a part of their operations today,” Which leads Enfusion to predict that these management will eventually transfer into partial or full cloud infrastructure for their operations.
  At this time, cloud-based software is changing the playing field for these investment managers and how they can manage their clients and change the scale of their business. Enfusion has been consistently growing in the past few years. 
  This growth can be seen through the number of awards they have been given in their time of success. For example, they’ve received recognition as the Best In Class Investment Management and Fund Accounting Systems by Aite.
  They have received a winning position as the Best Risk Management Technology Provider and Best Managed Service Provider from both the HFM U.S Services and the European Services, respectively.
  There is also plenty more awards that are given to this company for their global efforts at impacting the investment infrastructure. In comparison to other companies Enfusion is doing well.
  It has reached a broader global audience compared to other start-up investment software companies.
  Enfusion will, however, need to deal with the competition of investment software that are working in collaboration with already established investment institutions such as Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or TD Ameritrade since customers can keep their existing accounts while transferring to a seamless cloud-based software for their investments. 
  
### My Recommendations for Enfusion
---
Enfusion has the potential to grow into an even bigger and impactful especially given the current state of the world. 
  I think that for Enfusion to grow that they could also provide their clients detailed performance metrics so that they can assess how their investments are doing in comparison. I think it will give their clients feel more comfortable and allow them even more transparency in seeing how they are doing.
  I believe that outside of using Saas, Enfusion could also implement Pandas so that their data sets can have their financial performance metrics.
  I also feel like it would be beneficial to work with financial institutions that help people manage their investments such as Bank of America, Wells Fargo, etc.
  If they could offer these performance metrics to large financial institutions, they could build upon the foundation they already have.
